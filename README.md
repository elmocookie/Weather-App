# Hello World Project

## Purpose

This is a simple Hello World project - a minimal starting point for exploring and learning. Currently contains a single text file demonstrating the classic "Hello World" message.

This repository can serve as:
- A template for new projects
- A testing ground for tools and workflows
- A learning environment for development practices
- A placeholder for future project development

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- No special dependencies required
- Works on any system that can read text files

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the repository
cd "/Volumes/SAMSUNG/Macbook/Claude Code Project"
```

## Usage

### Viewing the Message
```bash
# View the hello world message
cat hello_world.txt
```

The output will display:
```
Hello World
```

### Editing the Message
You can modify `hello_world.txt` with any text editor:
```bash
# Using vim
vim hello_world.txt

# Using nano
nano hello_world.txt

# Or use any GUI text editor
```
